    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A constant at celebratory breakfasts and brunches, 
        eggs Benedict is easy to make when you break it down into its basic components--toast, ham, eggs, and hollandaise.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 English muffins</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices Canadian bacon</li>
        <li>Vinegar , just a splash</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Hollandaise sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice , or lime juice</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>For the Hollandaise sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Melt the butter in a small saucepan. 
                In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks. 
                Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and salt and pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well. 
                Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.
                ( Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure they don't curdle).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan. 
                Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds. 
                Remove from heat and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. 
                Stir well and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To poach the eggs:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Fill a medium size pot with about 3 inches of water. 
                Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. 
                You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, 
                but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup).  
                Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the cup.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you want your egg yolk. 
                Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                **It is not abnormal for a white foam to form on top of the water when poaching an egg. 
                You can simple skim the foam off of the water with a spoon.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                While the egg is cooking, 
                place the slices of Canadian bacon in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for about 1 minute on each side.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To assemble:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Toast the English muffin. 
                Top each toasted side with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, and then a poached egg. 
                Top with hollandaise sauce.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
