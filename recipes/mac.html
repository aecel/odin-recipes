      <p class="desc-text">
        Still the best Baked Mac and Cheese I've ever had in my life! Perfect in
        every way, this has a stunningly white, ultra creamy cheese sauce with a
        beautiful crunchy, buttery topping. Great one for serving at gatherings
        because it won't dry out and go stodgy like most Macaroni Cheese recipes
        because of the extra step of tossing the macaroni in butter (stops it
        from bloating) and because it's extra saucy out of the oven.

      <h3 class="section">Steps</h3>

      <h4>Pasta:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and
          cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss in butter: Drain, return pasta to pot, add butter and toss until
          melted. Set aside to cool while making the Sauce (Optional - Note 3).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Topping:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix together Topping. Set aside.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Sauce:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).</li>
        <li>
          Make roux: In a large saucepan or in an ovenproof skillet (I use my
          26cm/9" Lodge cast iron skillet), melt butter over medium heat. Add
          flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add milk: Add about 1 cup of the milk and mix to dissolve the paste
          into the milk. Then add remaining milk and mix until lump free (use
          whisk if required).
        </li>
        <li>Add Seasonings: Mix in salt and Seasonings if using.</li>
        <li>
          Thicken sauce: Cook, stirring/whisking regularly, for 5 - 8 minutes
          until thickened to a cream consistency. When the Sauce coats the back
          of a wooden spoon, you should be able to draw a path with your finger.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add cheese: Remove from stove, add cheese and stir - cheese doesn't
          need to melt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check salt: Adjust salt to taste (if you use recommended cheeses, you
          won't need more).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Assembling:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Assemble: Pour Sauce into pot with Macaroni. Stir quickly, then pour
          back into the skillet (I did this) or a baking dish (Note 4). Sprinkle
          with breadcrumb topping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 25 minutes or until top is light golden. Don't bake too long
          otherwise you'll bake away the Sauce!
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve: Serve immediately! I sprinkled mine with a bit of fresh
          parsley. See notes for best make-ahead method.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="section">Notes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Panko breadcrumbs are larger pieces than normal breadcrumbs which
          creates a really nice extra crunchy topping. It can be found in the
          Asian section of supermarkets here in Australia. Can sub with normal
          breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cheese
          <ul>
            <li>
              Main Cheese (2 cups) - my favourite is gruyere (used in video),
              for flavour and melting quality. Can use any flavoured melting
              cheese. Other cheeses I like for this include: cheddar, Monterey
              Jack, Colby, provolone. (Australia/NZ: Tasty cheese works & super
              tasty but sauce is not quite as smooth);
            </li>
            <li>
              I like to use mozzarella for the 2nd cheese (1 cup). It melts
              really well into the sauce, has that nice stretch, and isn't as
              oily like other cheese can tend to be. Also, it's less salty.
              However, you can just use more of the Main Cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always grate your own cheese for cheese sauces. Store bought
              shredded cheese have anti caking agents which don't melt so can
              give the sauce a slight powdery texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              SALTINESS of cheeses vary so if you use another cheese other than
              gruyere for the Main Cheese that is much less salty (eg
              Jarlsberg), you may need to add a pinch or two of extra salt into
              the sauce. Taste and check! Most cheeses are of similar salt
              levels though.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Tossing pasta with butter provides a light coating that helps prevent
          it from bloating while baking in the sauce. This is also the reason
          why I let the pasta cool before mixing in with the sauce. Optional
          step - can skip it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Baking dish size - 2.5L/2.5qt (10 cup) baking dish. A 9 x 13" / 23 x
          33 dish is perfect for a double batch, a little too big for a single
          batch (spreads too thinly, you want more depth).
        </li>
        <li>
          PREPARE AHEAD: Mac and Cheese is best made fresh but if you need to
          make ahead, this is the best way: Cook pasta and toss in butter, cool
          (this is important as hot pasta will absorb sauce and bloat). Make
          cheese sauce per recipe, mix through pasta, sprinkle on breadcrumb
          topping. Refrigerate or freeze (thaw fully in fridge before baking).
          Cover with foil and bake 15 minutes at 180°C/350°F. Remove foil then
          bake further 25 minutes until top is golden. (Fridge cold Mac & Cheese
          takes longer to bake).
          <p>
            REHEATING LEFTOVERS: Best way is to microwave to make warm then
            spray top with oil (or butter) and crisp under grill/broiler.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Nutrition per serving. 6 servings as a generous side - you will be
          surprised how far 250g/8oz stretches with a load of cheese sauce! Will
          serve 4 generously as a main.
        </li>
